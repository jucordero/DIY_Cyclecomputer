# Case

The case was created using Fusion 360.
It is made up of 5 bodies:

1. Main case
2. Back lid
3. Side button cap
4. Front left button cap
5. Front right button cap

The main PCB is held in place using M2.5 screws. A hex head 14 mm screw inserts from the front and attachs to two brass threaded inserts on the back lid.
Two plastic M2.5 6mm screws secure the top side of the back lid by attaching to two additional threaded inserts in the main case.
Threaded inserts are added to the case using a soldering iron.

The back lid has holes for 9 round 3x1mm neodynium magnets which are intended to be used as a mounting mechanism.
The magnets used are not very powerful so should be updating the design to either stronger magnets or a different mechanism.

The two front button caps are placed on top of two momentary rubber dome push buttons place either side of the GPS antenna.
The button on the side is a horizontal push button which is pressed by the side plastic button cap.
